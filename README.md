# Capstone-Project-Salifort-motor

## Overview
The goal of this project is to answer the question "What is likely to make employees leave the company?".

## Methodology
The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), creating data visualizations, creating a machine learning model, deriving insights from it, and preparing an executive summary document.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle.

## Model
-A random forest tree model was used to predict whether an employee will leave.
-We also tried models like Logistic Regression and Decision trees to solve this problem.

## Ethical Considerations
Throughout the project, ethical concerns were considered. One of the main concerns is that we are building a model that will be used to make decisions that will impact employees.
