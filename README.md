# Salifort Motors Capstone Project

## Overview
The goal of this project is to answer the question "what is likely to make employees leave the company?"[^1^][1].

## Methodology
The project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), creating data visualizations, creating a machine learning model, deriving insights from it, and preparing an executive summary document[^1^][1].

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is publicly available on Kaggle[^1^][1].

## Model
An XGBoost model was used to predict if an employee will leave or not[^1^][1].

## Deliverables
- The completed Jupyter notebook
- An executive summary
- The model that was built[^1^][1]

## Ethical Considerations
Throughout the project, ethical concerns were considered. One of the main concerns is that we are building a model that will be used to make decisions that will impact employees[^1^][1].

## Required Packages
- jupyter
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- xgboost[^1^][1]
